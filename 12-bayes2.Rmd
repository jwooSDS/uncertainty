# The Beta-Binomial Model, and Factors in Bayesian Modeling

```{r, echo=FALSE}

This module is based on Bayes Rules! (Johnson, Ott, Dogucu), Chapters 3 and 4. You can access the book for free at https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/.

The book is extremely readable, so I have not written any notes for this module. 

## Introduction

Chapter 3 introduces the Beta-Binomial model, which is used when the parameter of interest has a support between 0 and 1 (typically a probability), and the data follow a binomial distribution. A lot of the ideas are a continuation of the ideas from Chapter 2, but are now applied in a more realistic setting. 

Chapter 4 goes over how the prior and data affect the posterior model.
