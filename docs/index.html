<h2>Who is this book for?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#who-is-this-book-for"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>There are many books on linear models, with various expectations for different levels of familiarity with statistical, mathematical, and coding concepts. These books generally fall into one of two camps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Little to no familiarity with statistical and mathematical concepts, but fairly familiar to coding. These books tend to be written for programmers who want to get into data science. These books tend to explain linear models while trying to avoid statistical and mathematical concepts as much as possible. These books tend to present linear models in a recipe format giving readers directions on what to do to build their models.</li>
</ol>
<p>The drawback of such books is that readers do not get much understanding of the underlying concepts of linear models. It is impossible to give directions covering every possible scenario in the real world as real data are messy. Practitioners of data science often have to think outside the box in order to make linear models work for their particular data, and it is difficult to do so without understanding the mathematical framework of linear models.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Familiarity with mathematical notation and introductory statistical concepts such as statistical inference, and little to no familiarity with coding. These books tend to be written for mathematicians (or anyone with a strong background in mathematics) who want to get into data science. These books cover the mathematical framework of linear models thoroughly.</li>
</ol>
<p>The drawback of such books is that readers must be comfortable with mathematical notation. This limits the audience for such books to people with fairly thorough training in mathematics. People without such training will get lost trying to read such books, and do not understand why we need to know the mathematical foundations to use linear models in data science.</p>
<p>This book is meant to be readable by both groups of readers. Some foundational mathematical knowledge will be presented, but will be written so that is readable by anyone. This book will also explain what these knowledge mean in the context of data science. Practical advice, based on the foundational mathematical knowledge, will also be given.</p>
<p>This book accompanies the course STAT 6021: Linear Models for Data Science, for the Masters of Data Science (MSDS) program at the University of Virginia School of Data Science.</p>
<p>As introductory statistics and introductory programming are pre-requisites for entering the MSDS program, this book assumes basic knowledge of statistical inference and coding. Review materials covering these concepts are provided separately for enrolled students.</p>

<div id="chapters" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Chapters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#chapters"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The chapters for the book is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapters <a href="#wrangling"><strong>??</strong></a> and <a href="#viz"><strong>??</strong></a> focus on core R skills needed: data wrangling and data visualization. These are R skills needed to perform regression analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapters <a href="slr.html#slr">1</a>, <a href="inf.html#inf">2</a>, and <a href="#diag"><strong>??</strong></a> cover simple linear regression (SLR). This is the simplest scenario in regression when we have one predictor and one response variable that is quantitative. We are using this scenario to be able to more clearly explain concepts in regression before moving into the more practical multiple linear regression (MLR), which involves multiple predictors.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapters <a href="#mlr"><strong>??</strong></a> to <a href="#out"><strong>??</strong></a> cover multiple linear regression: when we have multiple predictors and one response variable that is quantitative.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapters <a href="#logistic1"><strong>??</strong></a> and <a href="#logistic2"><strong>??</strong></a> cover logistic regression: when we have a response variable that is binary.</p></li>

</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are using the provided R code from each chapter, please remember to clear your R environment whenever you move to a new chapter. This can be done by typing <code>rm(list = ls())</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>For Chapters <a href="slr.html#slr">1</a> to <a href="#logistic2"><strong>??</strong></a>, there is an R tutorial provided in the last section. You should also clear your R environment before running the code in the tutorials.</p></li>

<p>Some additional resources are provided for students enrolled in STAT 6021. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning objectives.</li>
<li>Explainer videos.</li>
<li>Practice questions.</li>
<li>Assignments.</li>

<div id="data-sets-used" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Data sets used<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-sets-used"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I have tried to use as many open source data sets as much as possible so that readers can work on the various examples I have provided on their own. However, some data sets may not be open source and were shared by other statistics and data science educators over my years of teaching this class (or variations of it) since 2013. It is my goal to eventually use only open source data sets.</p>

<p>This book is mostly a compilation of course notes that were originally written as separate chapters. While effort has been made to fix typos, issues may still exist. If you find any issues (typos, formatting, etc), please report them at <a href="https://github.com/jwooSDS/linear_models/issues" class="uri">https://github.com/jwooSDS/linear_models/issues</a>. Please be as specific as you can, including providing the specific section and paragraph where the issue is found.</p>

<h2>Other resources<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#other-resources"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Some other resources that readers may want to check out:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>OpenIntro Statistics</em>, 4th ed. Diez, Cetinkaya-Rundel, Barr, OpenIntro. Get free PDF version at <a href="https://leanpub.com/os" class="uri">https://leanpub.com/os</a>, just set the price that you want to pay to $0. This is a good book for introductory statistics.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Introduction to Probability for Data Science</em>, Chan. <a href="https://probability4datascience.com/index.html" class="uri">https://probability4datascience.com/index.html</a>. This book covers the fundamentals of probability and mathematics needed for data science. It does a good job explaining how seemingly abstract mathematical concepts are needed and applied in data science.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Linear Models with R</em>, 2nd ed. Faraway. This is probably one of the few books that balances between the two camps that I wrote about earlier. It does require familiarity with matrices and linear algebra though.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis</em>, 5th or 6th ed. Montgomery, Peck, Vining. You may be able to access an e-version of the book through your university library if you are affiliated with a university. This book is mathematically rigorous so is useful to those who are interested in mathematical proofs that is not covered.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Applied Linear Statistical Models</em> (ALSM), Kutner, Nachtsheim, Neter, Li, 5th ed. This book covers a wide range of topics in linear models and is also mathematically rigorous.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Applied Linear Regression Models</em> (ALRM), Kutner, Nachtsheim, Neter, 4th ed. ALRM is the same as the first 14 chapters of ALSM. The second part of ALSM covers topics in Design of Experiments, which I highly recommend if you are interested in those topics.</p></li>
